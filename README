EU deliverable documentclass for LaTeX
=========================================

Version 2.0 (2016-02-15)
------------------------

Usage
-----

The eu-deliverable class provides the basic structure of an EU deliverable.
For use in a particular project, you will need to redefine a number of fields;
see the sample james-deliverable class for details.

See file "sample.tex" for additional notes on usage.

To use the documentclass for a new deliverable, copy the files in this
directory (including the "images" subdirectory) and use "sample.tex" as a
template for a new document.
